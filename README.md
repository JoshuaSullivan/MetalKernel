# MetalKernel

[WWDC20 Presentation](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10021)

This is an example app trying to set up a Metal-based CIKernel. I'm currently having trouble with the Build Rules described in the video...
the one that is supposed to compile the .metal file into a .air file is complaining that the .air file doesn't exist.
